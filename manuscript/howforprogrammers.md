# Tips for programmers

You can't work all the time. I used to think that you could and nearly flunked out of high school as a result.

*"I have found a cure for sleep! Green tea with crap loads of sugar!"* I proudly exclaimed on a forum board shortly after my first dose of caffeine.

I was 15 or 16 and I had just declared war on sleep. There just wasn't enough time in the day for everything I cared about *and* all that stupid school stuff. Of course I thought school was stupid, I was a teenager and I knew best.

I spent my afternoons and nights programming in PHP - the most popular web programming language at the time. I squeezed in 10 minutes wherever I could and quickly rose to relative prominence in the phpBB community - a popular forum software of the time - as a plugin developer. Mine was the most popular plugin for topic descriptions with over 10,000 downloads.

Pretty good for a 17 year old huh?

On top of all that coding I was writing and drawing webcomics, getting my feet wet in making money as a web developer and starting novels that I never finished. I was on fire!

A native English teacher once started a group discussion with *"What do you think is the perfect amount of sleep?"*.

We used these discussions to practice speaking in English. Talking to a native was a special treat because he could only join us once in a while.

*"FOUR HOURS! Four hours is perfect."* I proclaimed feeling smug.

Everyone thought I was posturing. The teacher shrugged it off as me trying to be the class clown.

But I did go through most of my high school years sleeping about four hours a night. It was a dumb move and all that energy had to come from somewhere - school.

Every morning I was at least five minutes late. Every day I slogged through school like a zombie and barely registered what was going on around me. I had enough energy to avoid falling asleep, but my long-term memory was shot and I don't even want to try remembering what my comprehension levels were.

My grades hovered around D's, or 2's. Famously I once didn't get a single positive grade in Chemistry all year.

And then, in the evening, as if by magic I woke up and worked non-stop until 3 or 4am. Nothing could stop me. My biological rhythm was completely out of whack with what society expected.

My natural rhythm still isn't what many would consider normal, but I've found many ways of making it work and staying alert at all times.

## Mental energy

Intuitively we all know what it means when somebody says *"I'm full of energy today."*

Energy is that thing you have more of when you're rested and less of when you're tired. When you're full of energy you're buzzing around and can barely contain yourself, while somebody who's low on energy just sits there staring straight ahead with an empty expression.

Everybody also knows their energy fluctuates through the day depending on their natural cycle, how long they've been awake, what they eat and so on.

For instance, many say they feel a spike of energy when it's not quite morning anymore, but not quite lunch time yet. Then they feel slow after lunch and have another peak in the afternoon before winding down for dinner and then some people have another spike later in the evening while others fall right asleep and never pick up until next morning's work.

But what are we talking about anyway? What _is_ energy?

It's not exactly physical energy - that's measured in joules and relates to physical work. It's something more subtle than that. It's got almost as much, if not more, to do with how we _feel_ rather than how much we can lift, or move, or how far and fast we can run.

Feeling low on energy doesn't mean our physical energy is any lower. Sure, it's related, but you can be mentally tired and physically strong as ever. Or physically tired and your mind is racing.

What being full of energy means, is that our mental energy is high and we feel motivated and capable of doing work. Even excited.

Since the early 2000's scientists have been researching the concept of mental energy using a combination of cognitive performance measurements, self-evaluation questionnaires and tests of physical ability.

They've discovered our feelings of mental energy directly correlate to cognitive performance in terms of short term memory and ability to take decisions quickly. It didn't seem to have much effect on other cognitive performance factors, other than general motivation. Having high mental energy tends to mean you're more motivated to solve complex tasks, which makes you slightly better at them.

You're also able to hold focus better when you're rested, which does correlate with mental energy, and thus indirectly factors into your performance on cognitive tasks.

Interestingly enough, the same correlation holds for physical performance - higher mental energy means more focus, means a greater ability to overcome stressors, means better physical performance. Mostly in terms of endurance and maximum strength.

As such, there are two parts to the mental energy equation. 

On one hand it's a mood - how much energy you _feel_ like you have. This affects your performance through motivation.

On the other hand is the more interesting actual mental energy, which measurably affects your cognitive performance in short term memory and decision tasks. It's more interesting because it's more measurable and its effect is more pronounced.

More importantly, you can have high mental energy, without actually feeling like you are high in energy. This will 

[have to dig up studies again and add more specific quotes]

In short, your mental energy is a measure of how energetic you feel and how well you perform on certain mental tasks, but doesn't affect your physical performance or even most cognitive tasks.

Maintaining mental energy levels that are useful for quality programming is therefore mandatory.

[this justification is muddy at best, have to better present what tasks are affected and why they're important to programming]

The rest of **Tips for programmers** is about lifestyle choices that affect mental energy.

## Long hours

In July 2013 I visited the US to help bootstrap new startup team bootstrap. The main advice I had to give was focusing on working normal hours because that leads to better productivity.

This is obvious to everyone from Europe or who isn't used to working with startups. They adopt a US type of work culture even in Europe. Always being strapped for time and cash and having infinite competitors breathing down your neck makes young people want to work insane hours to make up for whatever they think is missing.

But in this startup we executed just fine working 11am to about 7pm. Eight to nine hours of office time, but including lunch and the morning wind up we were averaging about six hours of hard productivity per day.

A lot more than the maybe four hours of work [moments](http://www.ted.com/talks/jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen_at_work.html), as Jason Fried calls them, your average worker stacks up in an eight hour day.

We wanted to have a working minimum viable product ready in a month. And by ready I mean we wanted to let people loose without having to ask them not to click on things or apologizing about every other thing they try not working.

Zero lines of code to a finished product in a month is a tall order. Naturally, you want to start as soon as you wake up and work until you fall asleep on your keyboard.

This is the wrong impulse.

There are no long distance sprinters. A month is _a lot_ more time than you think. At five days a week and six hours of uninterrupted productivity per day, a month gives you 120 hours.

A good engineer can do _a lot_ with 120 hours of focused productivity. At competitions products are frequently launched in no more than two days. After a month we did end up with a presentable MVP.

It was great, but towards the end we panicked. That last week was the perfect example of why programmers shouldn't work long hours.

Friday was the day of the big investor meeting. What was supposed to be just a friendly *"Hey what are you up to?"* over lunch, turned into a proper meeting at the investor's office.

On Monday we panicked.

The product was well on its way, but you know how software projects are. Until it's done, it looks like it will never be done. Worse still, the last polishing touches take the longest.

There was no way we were going to let the founder go into that meeting with a product he doesn't feel comfortable letting the VC play with on their own. Time to do whatever it takes.

That Monday we took a very short lunch and worked until nine o'clock. To reward ourselves for getting lot done the engineering team went out for dinner, tentatively planning to work more afterwards.

We just had to get away from the computers for a bit, you see. Oh no we weren't tired at all. Who gets tired after a longish day of coding? Pfft, definitely not us!

Dinner lasted until eleven o'clock and we didn't do any more work that day.

Next day people came in to work before 11am. By eleven, everyone had finished eating breakfast and was coding furiously. There was a deadline to catch and nor hell nor high water would make us miss.

Lunch was a quick twenty minute break and we continued working furiously. After six or seven in the evening the dynamic started changing. There was more and more office chatter. First a conversation between two people wandering off into play land here and there, then more and more people migrating to the kitchen to stand around and chat.

By eight o'clock nobody was working.

They thought they were working. After all, they were at the office, they were talking about work, but nothing was getting done.

After a take-out dinner everyone got back to work around 10pm. At midnight, after some thirteen hours at the office, my brain reached a point where naming a new variable was a struggle, so I stopped.

Everyone else continued until 2am. I don't know how much they got done in those two extra hours, but the vibe was nothing at all like the vibe of a bustling place with everyone working at peak performance. It felt more like a town in the middle of a siesta full of tumbleweeds and old geezers lazily observing you from street-facing chairs.

Wednesday at 11am, the office was empty. Half the people staying at the startup house were barely waking up, the rest of us were eating breakfast. The commuters were nowhere to be seen.

Lunch was ordered in once more to save time. Everyone took care to pick a food within five minutes so there wouldn't be any delays. We were on fire!

Normally people would have to be dragged away from their work at lunchtime, but that Wednesday they jumped from their computers the moment delivery rang the bell. Then we sat outside in the shade, talked and ate. Despite the looming deadline nobody quite felt like getting up and going back to work.

We finished eating in ten minutes, but lunch took an hour.

We just sat there and talked. Some of it was about the work, some about the team, all of it unproductive. There was a lot of patting on the back over how productive we've been this week and how long hours we've worked. People need that. They say it as much to reassure themselves as to give kudos to the others.

That afternoon didn't feel as rushed and full of energy as Monday or Tuesday did. People got up to get something from the fridge more often. When somebody went to the kitchen many more eyes followed and a lot more people decided they needed a snack than they usually would.

By the time I returned from my evening run nobody was working anymore. They were hanging out in the kitchen making dinner. We decided to eat in to save time.

Dinner took until 10pm - two to three hours. Despite our best efforts to save time.

Last person to type something into the text editor gave up at 3am. Everyone else had started shifting from work mode to play mode around midnight. Think I gave up at a quarter to 1m when I reached some milestone I'd set for myself. The last two hours were spent on a tiny little thing I could have done in twenty minutes the next morning.

But such is life with deadlines. Doing something in two hours that you could do tomorrow in 20 minutes.

On Thursday we started even later. I doubt anyone at the office typed anything into a text editor before 12:30. The vibe in the office was that of a train station without shade when it's 38C out.

Sluggish mechanical movements. No brain. Only muscle memory.

Better had we all stayed home instead of come to the office and pretended we're being useful. But there was a deadline to catch don't you know? The product was coming together, but there were bugs to iron out.

There will always be bugs to iron out.

That afternoon the founder announced the meeting had been postponed for one scheduling conflict or another. A weight fell from the room and within an instant there was no more typing. No more deadly silence. Everyone stood up. Stretched. And started chatting.

At 7pm we stopped working. If anyone was even working at more than 20% ...

On Friday we were back to normal. No deadline. No pressure to work super late. We got it done. That evening the product worked.

The new meeting was on Monday morning. Sunday afternoon was bug fixing day - first time in the company's history that people were expected to work on a weekend.

Dangerous precedent for a month old company to set, but they'll learn. Long hours are debt you repay on the third day.

## Routine

Optimization parameters:
- as many peak productivity hours as possible
- peak productivity hours synced with energy cycles
- don't have naggy things get in the way
- mindfulness
- enough time to relax

-----

But there are ways to work long hours without burning out in less than a week. Through experiments I've stumbled on a routine that's helped me work consistently long hours at full blast with barely a problem.

After my burn out two years ago I had to figure out a way to get a lot done without getting too tired. The schedule of jumping out of bed at 9am still full of caffeine from the guarana pills I had taken before bed and then working until 4am through a haze of black tea and energy drinks with one or two long breaks just wasn't sustainable anymore.

My biggest discovery was routine.

All my life I had prided myself on being a free spirit who doesn't plan anything too far in advance. I never kept a ready schedule, woke up when I felt like it, ate when I was hungry, slept when I couldn't work anymore.

That isn't very productive. You spend most of your time figuring out what you're going to do next. In the morning you have to think about what you're going to do before lunch, which deadlines are most imminent and what do you want to accomplish. Or just what you feel inspired to work on.

Not a very good way to catch deadlines, and not a great way to get anything done. Too much overhead and uncertainty.

A steady routine works much better. Wake up at roughly the same time every day, always us the same process to gear up for work, have lunch in roughly the same time window every day, stop working and get to bed at similar times every day. Even use a similar sequence of events to fall asleep.

It might not be the most exciting life in the world and the strange feeling of "Holy crap, when did I become so organised? Is this even me?" might never completely go away, but you always know how much work time you have in a day and exactly how much you can get done.

The consistency makes conversations with your boss or client much easier. Yes you're only doing 6 billable hours per day, but you're banging out six solid hours of peak productivity day after day after day.

Most people can't ensure that even four days in a row.

### Pomodoro

The routine that works best for me is based around the pomodoro schedule.

Pomodoro is a time management technique discovered by Francesco Cirillo when he was studying for a lot of exams in college and had to find a way to work for hours on end without becoming tired. It worked and soon become popular all over the world, known as the pomodoro technique because he used a pasta cooking timer in the shape of a tomato. Pomodoro in Italian.

The idea is that when you sit down to work you turn on a 25 minute timer. While the timer is running your full attention should go to the task at hand. No internet, no tweeting and email and facebook, no conversations with coworkers. Just you and your task.

Then you take a 5 minute break.

During the break you can do whatever you want. Prowl around the internet, talk to the people around you, answer emails. Whatever you want.

After going through four pomodoros it's been two hours and you've done an hour and forty minutes of focused productivity. That's a lot more than it sounds. People can go weeks in an office environment without ever doing a solid hour and forty minutes of distraction-less work.

Now it's time for a longer break. I usually do a 30 minute break that is extended to 45 minutes if it's time to eat something, or shortened to 15 minutes if I'm full of energy and staying away from work feels like a struggle.

After two two hour sessions I take a longer break. At least two hours, sometimes three. This lets me deal away with the bigger meals of the day, boxing practice, chores around the house and so on. I try to use this time productively, but doing something other than work so my mind has a chance to relax and think through problems subconsciously.

The breaks are paramount to good coding without getting too tired. They can be very hard to take when you're feeling frustrated or things aren't working and you try to power through. But with some practice it's easy to achieve enough discipline that this doesn't happen very often.

When I do start ignoring my pomodoro timer it's often a sign that I am already completely wasted, banging my head against a brick wall and I should probably just get up and go for a walk because I am _not_ solving this problem tonight.

But while discipline matters, it's also important not to go overboard with following the rules.

When I started out using pomodoro I was strict to the point of nonsense. When the timer rang that the break is over I stopped reading the article and only continued after 25 minutes. I stopped writing tweets mid-word and so on.

In the beginning that's important, but it leaves a lot of unresolved tiny tasks behind that drag at your mind when you're working and keep pulling you out of the zone. You have to keep in mind where to get back to reading the article, you have to know what you wanted to say in that tweet and so on.

These days I use a more statistical than deterministic approach to the pomodoro technique. My breaks are 4 minutes on average with about a 2 minute variability. Sometimes I drag out the work time so I can finish writing a line of code and I start my break after 26 minutes of work. Sometimes a break drags on to become 6 minutes and I will often take my break a minute or so early if I'm already feeling tired.

Pomodoro is there to give your day structure, not to be just another thing to stress about.

### Morning

My old startup advisor once said *"When I go for a swim in the morning, nothing that happens for the rest of the day will make me feel like the day has been wasted."*

After years of experimentation I agree. My morning poison isn't exactly going for a swim, but I've also discovered that a good morning routine well followed will make you feel invincible for the rest of the day.

No matter what happens, you will always be in high spirits because you've already achieved something before your day even started. The morning doesn't have to be a mad dash to drown yourself in coffee and drive to work. That's not a morning, that's torture.

Now I'm no morning person by a long shot, but it still makes me sad when I talk to people who say that all they want to do in the morning is sleep for as long as possible and then grumpily climb out of bed, sit behind a computer and vegetate for the rest of the day. That's no way to lead a life!

Even worse are the people who grouch off to bed at 10pm so they can climb out of bed by 6am, drag themselves to work by 7 or 8am, then stare at the computer screen with bloodshot eyes for an hour while sipping on a large cuppa.

Just because their boss is a butt-in-seat-time kind of guy who doesn't care whether people are working, only that they're there.

I started working on my morning routine when I noticed that I don't get anything done before lunch. There isn't enough time between waking up and having to start cooking to get into flow and get anything done. More often than not I ended up lazily eating breakfast, watching television and hopping around the internet.

Over time I developed a morning routine that lets me get a lot done without actually doing any work work yet.

My current routine starts around 9am with brushing my teeth and checking if anything interesting happened on the internet while I was asleep. Then I exercise for about an hour - leg days take 50 minutes, arm days take 70 minutes. The PumpUp fitness app has a personal trainer mode that makes sure I keep on time and don't drag my breaks.

While working out I usually hang out on the internet during the breaks because staring at a wall for two minutes gets boring. 

After working out I start boiling eggs for breakfast and take a shower while they cook. It takes about 9 minutes from eggs in cold water, to perfectly boiled eggs. 8 minutes during summer, 10 during winter. Yes I measured; I like having a perfect breakfast every time.

During breakfast I sometimes watch a half hour TV show if there's something new to watch that day, or I just have a quick breakfast and stare out the window. The problem with shows is that they slow down the morning routine, but it's the cleanest way to fit keeping up with my stories into the day.

After breakfast I do my daily 750words and take five minutes to clean up the kitchen - unload the dishwasher, clean up after breakfast and so on.

When I'm done I have an hour or two left before lunch so I can write. More often than not I have to start cooking while writing  because the current morning routine is too long and I have to work on shortening it. But I might have less of a problem now that I've finished catching up on Dr. Who, which has hour long episodes that I don't have the discipline to stop watching as soon as I finish breakfast.

After lunch I've had a super productive morning, finished most of my chores, done my writing for the day and can focus completely on my coding work for the rest of the day. Nothing can stop me.

The exact routine you choose doesn't matter, find one that works best for you and fits into the timeframe you have. I can get away with a very long morning routine because I work from home as a freelancer so there is no commuting to factor in, no external work schedule to keep and my clients don't care _when_ I do billable work. Just that I do the amount we've agreed on and that I spend the time well.

What matters most is that your routine is set in stone. There should be no guessing what comes next, no figuring out what to have for breakfast and you should generally minimize the amount of decisions you have to make before you even get started on working because there's only so many decisions you can make in a day. Most of the things you do should just be the default.

For instance, I can pick from only one of two breakfasts, an app decides how I exercise and the sequence of events is always the same.

The factors you're optimizing for are:

- be fully awake (exercising)
- clear away small nagging tasks (dishes etc.)
- clear away all concerns and worries (750words)
- reflect on what your day will look like (750words)

Experiment. Have fun.

[this part needs to be turned around so it starts with the optimization parameters and then extrapolates my routine from those]

### Evening

Another important part of the day is your evening routine. It helps you wind down from the day, sleep better and wake up in great shape next morning.

To be honest I haven't paid as much attention to perfecting my evening routine as I have the mornings. In part because it doesn't feel as important, in part because evenings often get messed up by the crud that accumulates through the day, various social engagements and because I don't tend to have a lot of evening left after I'm done working.

My evenings are usually split in two parts. Evening proper when everyone else is having their evening as well and late night evening when I wind down from work to get some sleep.

The first part of my evening comes when I have to leave for boxing practice. Ideally after two pomodoro sessions - 4 hours of work - but can fall on a session and a half if I take too much time for lunch. On the days I don't have boxing practice I usually go for a run or do some other physical activity.

This gives me an hour and a half of strenuous activity to get a break from work and give me enough time to think through the problems I've encountered that day. It's also just a generally good way to vent any pent up frustrations. Nothing like punching   it out on a punching bag or running it off when you've been stuck on a tiny problem all day.

After coming back from boxing I always make the same dinner - rice with veggies and chicken. You can buy all the ingredients en bulk so it runs pretty cheap per meal and it's also very filling, healthy and tasty enough that you never get bored of it. Or at least I don't.

I also haven't been able to find any other dinner that wouldn't leave me starving after a heavy boxing practice.

Always having the same dinner again plays into my theory of minimizing the amount of choices you have to make per day and because rice takes about 15 minutes to cook, putting it on the stove while you take a shower works out perfectly.

After dinner and hanging out with whomever's home at the time I can get back to work for another few hours. Usually a pomodoro session or two depending on how much work I've got left since the afternoon and how many problems I figured out while exercising.

My second evening falls between midnight and 1am. This one is devoted to winding down, clearing out my inbox and generally taking it easy. This is the only time in the day devoted to email because email is the least important thing I have to do.

If I still have energy left after dealing with all the email I will often do another hour of writing and go to sleep. Otherwise I watch a TV show of some sort and fall asleep while watching it.

Although I try to minimize how often I do that because I've discovered a correlation between falling asleep with a show on and oversleeping in the morning. Seems like I wake up much better when I just lay down, put on some white noise, and sleep.

Even when I fall asleep in roughly the same time. I don't know what's going on, but perhaps my sleep is lighter for as long as the show lasts because I keep trying to watch it despite dozing off.

Almost everybody I talked to while researching for this book spoke of a similar bipartite evening situation. After they're done working for the day they will go home to have dinner and spend time with their families. Afterwards some of them get back to work for a few hours - usually the half-manager types who find this to be the only quality coding time they can find - others do side projects or work on a hobby.

Afterwards everyone does something to wind down and go to bed, whether it's a glass of whiskey or a good book doesn't really matter. As long as you can relax enough to stop thinking about work and have a clear divide between sleeping time and working time.

Those who just work until they drop don't report good results in their or their work's wellbeing.

### Off days 

A strict routine where every day follows the same pattern is great for predictability, minimizing the amount of decisions you have to make about mundane things, but it also starts grating on the nerves after a while. As days blend into one and you start feeling more and more like a terrible person wasting their adventurous spirit, it's time to do something drastic.

Like put on different socks!

No, we're not that boring around here. But you do need days that don't follow a strict routine and let you be adventurous with your time. Same as diets really.

Staying in your pajamas all day watching television and eating chocolate is not an off day. It's being a lazy bastard. An off day is a productive day taken at a slower pace and with less routine.

My off days come on weekends. I like to take both days easy by sleeping in and having a much shorter exercise regime in the ten minute range instead of an hour. Usually I will skip rope for ten minutes and call it quits. Weekends are also my reading time so I either read while waiting for lunch after working out in the morning or focus on reading for an hour or two after lunch. The rest of the day is spent either longboarding, working on writing or playing with a pet project.

It doesn't matter what you end up doing, the important thing is that it's something you deem productive yet relaxing and that it's something you don't usually have time for during the week. Reading and longboarding are perfect activities for me because they are both productive and I rarely have time for them during the week when my focus are freelancing projects.

Reading helps my writing style so it's productive and it amounts  to laying in bed while enjoying a good story so it's relaxing as well. Similarly longboarding is a good exercise while also being pure fun.

In the end it doesn't matter what activities you pick for your off days as long as you consider them a good use of your time and they break the routine.

And remember, needing lazy days is a sign of burnout. Follow the advice from this book and you shouldn't need them unless you've been drinking or surfing too much the previous day.

## Health

There is no _One Weird Trick_. The internet has lied to you. But I'm not here to lie, I'm here to tell you that the only way to achieve peak productivity and coding bliss is to be healthy.

Your health depends on nothing but yourself. _You_ have to watch what you eat, _you_ have to get enough rest, _you_ have to exercise. You.

### Food

There isn't much I can tell you about food because I'm not a nutritionist, but I _can_ tell you that what you eat matters a lot. Food has a large impact on your productivity in the short term and the health benefits of a good diet will affect your productivity in the long term.

The important thing about food is that common sense matters most. You don't have to go for modern fad diets and fancy nutrition tricks to be healthy and have uniform energy levels throughout the day. Listen to your mother and your grandmother and you'll be fine.

If your grandmother is anything like mine she tries to put you in a food coma every time you visit. That's because she loves you, look at how she's eating otherwise - a lot of small meals throughout the day with a few large meals to give everything structure.

Maybe it's a living on a small farm thing, or just their age, but my grandparents wake up at 6am and begin their day with a small breakfast. Coffee and a bite of something with carbs. I don't think the coffee is necessary, but carbs provide an oomph of quickly digestible energy to wake you up.

After they tend to the animals and do other small things around the house it's time for a proper breakfast. Around the time normal humans wake up - 9am. This breakfast is a larger meal that includes protein as well. It's meant to replenish the energy you lost doing physical work and provide a solid base for the rest of the day.

This is the only breakfast I eat. It fits perfectly after my morning exercise and according to my calorie tracker leaves me at net zero calories even though it's substantial. Protein and fat digest much slower than carbs, which ensures I don't get a boost of hyperactivity that would tire me out right after breakfast while also making sure there's plenty of energy to wait for lunch without starving.

For my grandparents the midday lunch is something quick and small, but substantial. Substantial enough to be cooked and often eaten warm while sitting down, but should work as something you eat on the go. Sometimes it's prepared in advance so you can eat it in the field when you're working, because making the trip back home just for lunch doesn't make sense time-wise.

As a lazy person with a modern job that doesn't require me to run around the fields, I take lunch at home while watching television. But it's always something I can throw together in a few minutes and the whole lunch thing shouldn't take more than half an hour or so.

The rest of the day depends on the type of work you're doing. If you're out plowing the fields and chasing the light, or like taking your afternoons in uninterrupted blocks like I do, then you need another small snack about halfway through the afternoon.

I don't know what my grandparents do for this, but I like to make a smoothie. It's a quick pick-me-up for the afternoon that I can make in ten minutes and then drink while working. The carbs in fruit burn fast to give me an energy boost and the fats in milk burn slowly to keep me going for a while.

Smoothies are also a tasty way of ensuring you get your vitamins.

But you can easily switch this afternoon snack with a proper dinner - the third large meal of the day. Dinner should contain all three macro-nutrients and provides a solid base for the rest of the evening. You can think of it as the breakfast of the night.

A lot of people advise that you shouldn't eat after 6pm and I think that's bullshit. Sure, don't eat more than two or three hours before sleep, that does help, but if your bedtime is 2am the 6pm thing is not relevant.

If you take dinner early then I suggest having another light snack halfway through the evening.

In short, my grandparents eat five times a day. Three large meals. Two small meals. Roughly every three hours.

Same as them, I eat five times a day, except I move the 6am breakfast to a midnight snack. The snack ensures I can work until 2am and don't wake up starving.

Eating every three hours might sound like a lot of work, but becomes easy once you get used to it. You'll never feel hungry, will always have a steady supply of energy and most importantly you will never go into foraging mode where you start eating bites of random snacks you can find.

Those are unhealthy and will never make you feel full. That's how you get fat.

Other than a schedule of eating many small meals throughout the day, food is about nutrition. There's no need to go overboard worrying about this. Eat your fruits, eat your veggies, make sure you get enough fat, protein and carbs and avoid sugar.

Yes, rapping on sugar is modern right now, but for me it's a simple matter of fast burning vs. slow burning foods. Eating slow burning foods - meat, whole wheats, fat etc. - provides a steady source of energy for a few hours. Eating fast burning foods like processed wheat (white bread, white pasta, …) or sugar will give you an energy spike that leaves you hungry and tired after half an hour.

Sugar and simple carbs in general have been linked to feelings of fatigue and decreased mental performance after a short period of time. I haven't discovered a study that shows a direct link, but read several that found a correlation.

In short, don't sweat your diet too much. Once you cut obviously unhealthy things you will find you can eat anything your body tells you to. It takes a month or two for sugar to become a thing of the past and then you won't even crave it anymore. Most sugary things will just taste too strong to be tasty.

A few years ago I found a cake with 10+ spoons of sugar in the dough to be too bland. Nowadays anything more than a single spoon burns my tongue.

Oh and don't fall in the trap of various modern pop diets that say you shouldn't eat grains or whatever other nonsense because our ancestors ate differently and that's supposedly more healthy for us. It's not.

We are not our ancestors and anyone who tells you that our digestive system hasn't changed for the last 100,000 years is an idiot. We evolved at least the ability to digest lactose less than 5,000 years ago. Who knows what else is different.

Enjoy being a modern human, eat well.

### Exercise

Reading the warning labels on a new mouse or keyboard always makes me laugh. *"Warning, using this product may cause permanent injury. Consult your physician before prolonged use."*

*"Pha, it's a keyboard! Injury schminjury."*, I'd think before plomping my arse down and typing for twelve hours straight.

But the warnings are right. 

If you aren't careful, computing is a dangerous sport. You weren't made to sit around all day moving nothing but your fingers. When was the last time you saw a five year old sit around all day staring at a screen? And if you have, please wind their mother's ears.

As my old gym teacher would say before sending me into a dodgeball game as cannon fodder: *"Exercise is the cornerstone of a healthy life."*

Exercise is a funny thing, everyone knows they should do it, but few of us do do it. If you want to be a lazy fuck there's nothing I can do about that. But everyone who's sucked it up and started exercising regularly has said it's made their lives better.

You don't have to average two to three hours of exercise per day as I do. If you just want to be healthy and have more energy, a few minutes a day is plenty. Anything more than that is a hobby.

I have a friend who is a stereotypical geek. He doesn't really work out, but has a good enough metabolism that he can eat almost anything without getting fat. His poison during the summer is longboarding to the office and back.

When winter hit he couldn't do that anymore. His mood started going down and at one point his day was waking up groggy, walking to the office in a daze, working for a few hours, coming  home and crashing because he was so tired.

He couldn't figure out why he was so tired until one day it hit him: No more longboarding. No more taking half an hour instead of ten minutes to get home in a round about way.

One day he bought a room cycle and started cycling for ten or twenty minutes every day. Almost instantly he was back to his old self. His sleep improved, he wasn't as tired at work and when he got back home there was plenty of energy left to do the things he loves.

That's all it takes. A few minutes a day.

### Sleep

Laying in bed every night for hours on end might feel like a waste of time, but it's the most important thing you do as a human being. We don't know exactly what happens during sleep, but we do know what happens if you don't get enough.

Sleep deprivation is one of the most effective torture methods used in interrogations because it breaks the human spirit completely. Strangely enough, if you're a modern office worker there is a near hundred percent chance you are regularly depriving yourself of sleep without even realizing it.

Prolonged sleep deprivation affects your ability to consolidate memories, which makes it appear like you have a bad memory. A foggy recollection of events, yesterday feeling like it was a week or two away, difficulty placing events in the correct sequence, things like that. [sauce]

It appears that the brain does some sort of defrag operation during sleep that ensures all our memories are catalogued and reasonably accessible. This is also why sleep is an important factor in making learning more efficient. [sauce]

A more instant effect of sleep deprivation is every hour of sleep deprivation drops your cognitive ability by about 25%. Essentially, every hour of sleep you missed last night has made you a quarter worse at programming. 

No wonder I feel so dumb after a long night. I remember times when I pulled an all nighted working on something and while I wasn't exactly sleepy the next day I was just not quite there. Following a conversation was difficult, my eyes were barely kept open by energy drinks and work looked more like deranged scrolling up and down a file trying to think of a name for the variable I'd just created.

The coolest effect of sleep deprivation, if you're into that sort of thing, is that after a while it starts having hallucinogenic effects. You probably don't want those while coding a mission critical system though.

However, the amount of sleep you should get to avoid sleep deprivation depends on how much sleep you need naturally. Your mother has probably told you that you should get at least eight hours of sleep every night, but research has shown that 7.5 is the optimal average for adults. [sauce]

Through experiments I've found my own sweet spot at six hours give or take 30 minutes. It depends on how tired I am and how much mental effort I'd gone through, but five hours leaves me a bit foggy and anything much more than seven makes me either too hyperactive to work or wasted all day.

Experiment to find your own sweet spot.

You might be surprised by how little sleep you actually need once it's effective. As natural as sleep is, a lot of people are just plain terrible at it. Either they lay in bed waiting to fall asleep for far too long or wake up tired and groggy.

For refreshing sleep you are optimizing your sleep for the REM - rapid eye movement - stage of sleep. Occurring roughly every 90 minutes this is the dreaming sleep stage. During REM your brain is as active as while you are awake, but your body is completely paralysed to prevent acting out your dreams.

REM is usually followed by a period of very light sleep that is the perfect opportunity for waking up fresh as a flower. Missing this window of opportunity will leave you feeling worse than if you hadn't slept at all.

A simple way to make sure you're waking up at the right moment is making sure the amount of sleep you get is an increment of 90 minutes. Experiment a bit to find the exact timing for yourself as the cycle length can vary between individuals and usually shortens towards the end of the night - we dream more and more often towards the morning.

Another great tool are sleep apps for your phone. They monitor your sleep with the phone's accelerometers (yes, you have to sleep with your phone) and sound the alarm at the best moment in a thirty minute time window. My favorite is SleepTime by Azumio because it shows fancy graphs of my sleep and plays white noise that helps me relax before sleep.

The best way of describing the difference between a normal alarm and one synced to your sleep cycle is that a normal alarm wakes you up and a modern alarm _reminds_ you to wake up.

After fixing your wakeup, it's also important to fix the timing.

Sleep is only effective when it's synced properly to your natural circadian rhythm. This is why sleeping all day never seems to quite cut it and why jet lag feels so terrible. Ideally you should be asleep 6 hours before your body temperature reaches its lowest levels.

This one might be difficult to figure out, but I personally seem to be freezing at around 8am no matter the situation. Therefore I should be going to bed at around 2am, which is exactly what my normal routine looks like.

When all those factors line up something magnificent happens: you're always rested, you never feel sleepy during the day, and you fall asleep almost as soon as your head touches the pillow. No matter how much stuff might be rushing through your head.

### Caffeine

In high school most of my friends worried about getting the girls and finding the best parties, but I worried about being the next Turing or Carmack. My already limited coding time felt wasted on sleep so I started looking for a cure.

The first cure I found for late night drowsiness was green tea with plenty of sugar. Caffeine.

Caffeine is probably the safest and most effective stimulant you can easily get your hands on. Pretty much everything that says it's got stimulative effects and you can find in a normal store contains caffeine. Coffee, tea, chocolate, energy drinks, cold medicine. Everything.

Reading research on caffeine really makes it sound like a wonder drug and I will never understand why some people avoid it so much.

Several long-term observational studies have shown that chronic consumption of caffeine (three or more cups of coffee per day) significantly decreases your chance of death from _any_ factor. If you consume caffeine you are simply less likely to die. Period.

The biggest effect however was on cardiovascular disease and mental deterioration linked to aging. Drinking large amounts of caffeine - more than 300mg - every day will significantly lower your chances of dementia and Parkinson's disease, while any dose whatsoever will help against some cardiovascular disease

Better still, it seems that long-term habitual use of caffeine is either _inversely proportional_ to chances of certain diseases, or has no effect whatsoever. It doesn't cause high blood pressure, doesn't affect diabetes etc.

But you do get used to caffeine. The more you drink the more you're going to have to drink. While some studies report the effect of caffeine _increases_ with habitual use, a lot of people suggest for most of us caffeine does nothing but restore normality because we are so used to it.

One thing to keep in mind is that caffeine as a mental stimulant only works when you are sleep deprived. A well rested individual might well not drink any.

This is because caffeine is an adenosine inhibitor. Adenosine is a chemical that inhibits the activity in our central nervous system whose concentrations correlate to how long we've been awake - makes you sleepy after you've been up for long enough.

Caffeine binds to adenosine receptors giving adenosine nowhere to go, which makes you feel more awake. This has its limits but works well enough for caffeine to increase your cognitive capacities on all measures. You're better able to concentrate, make good decisions, your short-term memory improves, solving difficult problems is easier, you think faster and so on. Even your mood improves!

Inhibiting adenosine is not the only thing caffeine does to your brain. Part of its effect goes to increasing blood flow to your brain and increasing your metabolism. This means the brain has more oxygen and more energy to work with.

All of that happens if you are sleep deprived. If you just woke up caffeine will do next to nothing. It might elevate your mood a bit because you're used to it and it will increase blood flow to your brain to some extent, but mostly you're just fooling yourself that morning coffee is doing anything.

And placebo has been shown to work less well than caffeine. Sorry.

But caffeine is great as a physical stimulant as well. In all parts of the day. I haven't found an article explaining why or how, but caffeine increases your muscular coordination, improves your endurance, your reflexes and just generally improves all parts of your physical performance.

No wonder working out after a can of red bull feels so great.

Just remember drinking caffeine and going right into a boxing match does not work well. You have to give it 20 to 30 minutes before caffeine starts working its magic. I learned that the hard way ...

On that note, make sure you replenish your caffeine supply after a while. Most of the effects last for about four hours then start tapering off. The more tired you are, the harder the crash is going to be so be prepared. If you want to keep riding the caffeine high drink a new dose every three to four hours.

Luckily you don't have to worry about overdosing on caffeine. If you're a healthy adult, you can safely take up to 1000mg per day for the rest of your life. That's equivalent to 13 shots of espresso or six cans of Monster. 

Please don't drink six cans of Monster per day, there's probably a good reason the can says you shouldn't have more than one.

Caffeine is therefore a perfect drug. You can use as much as you want all of your life and you will be an all round better human. _If_ you're okay dealing with severe dependence and withdrawal symptoms when you don't get your fix.

Your choice.

### Other stimulants

Caffeine is by far not the only stimulant people use. Just the most common.

Ginseng is another phytonutrient I apparently drink a lot of with my energy drinks. It is said to have stimulative properties and make your brain work better, but a study I found comparing the effects of common stimulants concluded it does exactly bupkis.

Doesn't increase your cognitive or physical performance any more than a placebo would. But I doubt that will stop energy drink manufacturers from using it. Maybe it has an effect when combined with the other things? I don't know.

Ephedrine is another popular option. I haven't used it, but according to the same article rapping on ginseng, ephedrine is even more effective than caffeine in some cognitive tests. [which?]

Unlike caffeine ephedrine is a melatonin inhibitor. Your body produces melatonin depending on how much light hits your retinae, which makes you sleepy in the evening. This is why it's easier to stay awake when you leave the lights on and look at bright computer screens all evening.

Interestingly, ephedrine produces a bigger effect in many tests than caffeine does and because it acts primarily on melatonin you can combine the two for a greater effect than either ephedrine or caffeine on their own.

I have yet to experiment with ephedrine, but am going to as soon as I figure out where I can get some.

The only stimulant other than caffeine that I've tried was methylone and I don't recommend that as a performance enhancer. It is structurally similar to MDMA so it's more of a party drug anyway. 

When I tried methylone I specifically wanted to test how well it worked for improving cognitive performance. At first it seemed to work very well - I improved my time my record in a Colin McRae game by almost a minute on a 4 minute track. It felt like I could see into the future and was so at one with the car and keyboard that my reflexes were far too fast to follow with my conscious mind.

But the stimulating effect became too much after about twenty minutes and I could no longer focus enough to follow the game. My muscle response became too rigid as well and I lacked the fine motor control required to type with any finesse.

Not a very productive stimulant therefore, but I did talk like the wind all night, unable to stop, my mind kept racing and I couldn't sit still until about 8am when I was physically exhausted but had a hard time falling asleep.

The hangover was very physical. Like I had been doing hard physical labor all day.

I suspect a lot if not all street stimulants will have a similar effect of making you too hyperactive to be of any use behind a computer. Maybe you can circumvent that with very precise dosing, but I wouldn't bet on it.

However there is great potential in pharmaceuticals.

I've heard adderall is a popular option in the United States. The diagnosis of attention deficit disorder is so popular there, you can get adderall as easily as marijuana on most campuses. That's what I've heard anyway.

The effects on healthy individuals seem to be very beneficial. It doesn't really speed you up like caffeine would, but makes it very easy to focus.

Another viable option for long nights is modafinil. Prescribed for narcolepsy its mode of action remains unclear, but it removes your need for sleep. You just will not feel tired, there is apparently no hangover, and from what I could find there are no side-effects if you are otherwise healthy.

You might develop normal sleep deprivation side-effects like poor long-term memory and eventually hallucinations if you stay awake for too long. 

Plan to get some sleep every night!

I haven't tried most of this stuff, just read about it. I'm not condoning the use of these chemicals, but they are out there and some people are using them.
